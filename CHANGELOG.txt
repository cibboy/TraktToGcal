-- CHANGELOG --

1.0.2.0
First complete version. It includes pretty much everything - at least the basic functionalities. It still misses exception/error handling, better async handling and a real application icon.

1.1.3.0
Added error handling on main functions with custom error form. Not tested on errors on asyn calls.

1.2.8.0
Added two new options: exclusion of special episodes ("season 0" episodes) and possibility of creating events with a start and end time. Previous custom reminders shouldn't be lost anymore.
