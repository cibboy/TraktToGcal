-- CHANGELOG --

1.0.2.0
First complete version. It includes pretty much everything - at least the basic functionalities. It still misses exception/error handling, better async handling and a real application icon.

1.1.3.0
Added error handling on main functions with custom error form. Not tested on errors on asyn calls.

1.2.8.0
Added two new options: exclusion of special episodes ("season 0" episodes) and possibility of creating events with a start and end time. Previous custom reminders shouldn't be lost anymore.

1.3.10.0
Search and Proceed buttons are both disabled when either one is clicked, in order to prevent concurrent remote operation.

1.4.15.0
Added private data access through clear text password (in config file) or base64 hash. Due to this new possibility, requests are now made through https.

1.5.16.0
Corrected a bug that transformed user's local time of the show into UTC time.
