- Updated to trakt API v2
  - Updated settings page for handling client ID and client secret for trakt oauth
  - Moved google username and trakt username over to settings.json and client ID and client secret (as well as access token) to traktauth.json in order to allow execution of 1.x and 2.x executables without interfering with each other

1.5.16.0
Corrected a bug that transformed user's local time of the show into UTC time.

1.4.15.0
Added private data access through clear text password (in config file) or base64 hash. Due to this new possibility, requests are now made through https.

1.3.10.0
Search and Proceed buttons are both disabled when either one is clicked, in order to prevent concurrent remote operation.

1.2.8.0
Added two new options: exclusion of special episodes ("season 0" episodes) and possibility of creating events with a start and end time. Previous custom reminders shouldn't be lost anymore.

1.1.3.0
Added error handling on main functions with custom error form. Not tested on errors on asyn calls.

1.0.2.0
First complete version. It includes pretty much everything - at least the basic functionalities. It still misses exception/error handling, better async handling and a real application icon.
